#ifndef ECO_CONTAINERS_H_
#define ECO_CONTAINERS_H_

/*******************************************************************************
 **
 ** Containers exchanged between ATS and EcoSIM (adapted from Alquimia).
 **
 ** These are passed directly to the Fortran routines, which mirror them as
 ** bind(C) types in EcoSIM's EcoContainers.F90 (EcoContainers_module). Member
 ** order and types must match exactly; ecosim_container_sizes() lets ATS
 ** check the sizes at setup.
 **
 ** Roles, by direction and lifetime:
 **   EcoSizes          dimensions
 **   EcoConfig         ATS -> EcoSIM, once at setup: run parameters and flags
 **   EcoEnvironment    ATS -> EcoSIM, at setup and every advance: soil state
 **                     and properties, geometry, forcing, prescribed
 **                     vegetation, clock. Owned by ATS; never read back.
 **   EcoFeedback       EcoSIM -> ATS, every advance: what ATS physics uses
 **                     from EcoSIM. snow_depth is also sent in (EcoSIM's snow
 **                     state); the incoming sources are not used by EcoSIM.
 **   EcoInternalState  EcoSIM-private carried state and outputs, stored by
 **                     ATS without interpreting it (ATSStateRegistryMod).
 **
 ** Members marked "not filled" or "placeholder" are carried over unchanged
 ** from the earlier BGCState/BGCProperties and are to be fixed separately.
